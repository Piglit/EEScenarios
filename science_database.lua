When he went bankrupt, the Icarus station shipyards picked it up for a song. After Cobra was crippled in early April of 2020, Mike Sandusky worked hard to salvage it or get another similar model. He had recently remade his fortune through gambling winnings. Station Sovinec, a known hub for cheap (or wrecked) hulls said they had one and Icarus Patrol was asked to try to get it in may. Sandusky paid heavily for the privilege. Alas, the hull was already gone. Finally in June, Sandusky scrounged the necessary parts and rebuilt Cobra.\n\nFor several months, he flew around showing off his restored ship. In September, CUF requisitioned the Cobra for use by Icarus Patrol. Unfortunately, Cobra did not survive the mission.

A couple of those missions involved chasing around looking for T'k'nol. During her maintenance cycle, the technicians in Icarus shipyards improved her beam strength and cycle time. When Rattler was redeployed in July2020, she was severely damaged by Exuari while trying to protect freighters working on defense platforms around Icarus station.

During her next mission, she joined a convoy of CUF ships to get parts and supplies from station Sovinec. However, upon return from Sovinec, She was taken out by Exuari while defending Icarus\n\nIn May2020, Angus McDaniels procured another Squid type hulk. As part of the refit, Angus personally verified that the shields were beefed up. Reports hint that he was mumbling about 'cursed careless crews.' The Gabble redeployed Nov2020 but did not survive Kraylor activity in the Kentar region. Some of Gabble's crew may have been abducted via Kraylor actions against escape pods deployed near Gabble's location\n\nInk is a slight redesign of Squid with stronger shields and one more repair crew. Original Squid specs had shields at 70/70")
